CS311: Final Project 
Caroline Cutter + Julia Fairbank

HONOR CODE:
We have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this assignment.
All group members were present and contributing during all work on this project.


Files Required: data_scrape.py, lloyds.py, wine_data.csv, wine_data.txt 


CODE FILES: 

- data_scrape.py --->   This method turns the data from the CSV into a txt file.
    			The file needed is wine_data.csv and the information is
    			written to "wine_data.txt"

- lloyds.py -------->   This python code contains implementations of Lloyd's method with
    			5 different initalization methods (MacQueen, Forgy, K-Means++,
    			Naive Sharding and Cutter-Fairbank Method). When this code is run,
    			it will run for 100 iterations for each initialization method
    			and information about accuracy, iterations and time will be written
    			to a CSV file called "lloyds_data.csv". The files needed are
    			wine_data.txt and wine_data.csv. The second half of this code
    			contains the graphing code for the wine clustering. 

- wine_data.csv ----> wine data in the form of a CSV file 

- wine_data.txt ---->  wine data in the form of a txt file 



DATA ANALYSIS FILES: 

- lloyds_data.csv ----> contains the data that comes from running lloyds.py

- lloyd_analysis.R ---> contains R code that analyzes the data from lloyds algorithm. 
			Must have the "lloyds_data.csv" to run. 


- Graph Folder -------> contains all the graphs created from the lloyd_analysis.R code 
			and Lloyds.py code
